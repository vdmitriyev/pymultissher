## About

pymultissher is a simple CLI tool that runs commands on multiple servers at once using SSH.

## Why "yet another" SSH tool?

There is already endless number of tools and utilities, which are able to run commands on a cluster of servers over SSH (e.g., ansible, fabric, paramiko, you-name-it). However, from time to time you just need a pure CLI tool, which take a collection domains and runs a given command on them using SSH and provide back a gathered output. This is exactly what [pymultissher] is for. SSH heavy-lifting is done by [Paramiko](https://www.paramiko.org/)
