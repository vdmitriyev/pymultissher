## About

pymultissher is a simple CLI tool that runs commands on multiple servers at once

## Why "yet another" SSH tool?

There is alredy almost endless number of tools and utilities, which are able to run commands on a cluster of servers over SSH (e.g., ansible, fabric, etc.). 
However, sometimes you just need a simple and pure tool, which take a collection servers names, run a given command on all them using SSH and provide gathered output. This is exacly what [pymultissher] is for. SSH heavy-lifting is done by [Paramiko](https://www.paramiko.org/)
